### Overview

Please provide the following:
- A brief description of the project.
  ## Gamifly is a platform aiming at creating an inclusive and accessible community for global sports fans. 
  ## We deliver year round, global and digital experiences to our community, enabling exclusive social interactions, competitive on-chain esports, digital asset ownership and trading of team memberships etc.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.
  ## we have significant onchain UAW (50-100k per week) and txns (1 million txns per week). We can drive mass adoption for VeChain sustainably as we are running at a profit and scaling up means higher profitability.
  ## our ranking on DappRadar can be viewed here: https://dappradar.com/dapp/gamifly/?range-ds=30d
  ## As an indication, we can double VeChain's active wallets from 2.2 million today within 4-8 weeks, because of our active user base.
- If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project. 
## MPP / Transaction Fee delegation will definitely be integrated to help drive mass adoption. Our main objective is to drive mass adoption for Web3, which requires MPP / fee delegation.

### Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?
  ## There is no direct competitor in the market today. Sorare and Chiliz are similar projects involved in sports fan engagement. We are different from them in terms of 3 aspects:
  ## 1. We are focusing on Asia Pacific market
  ## 2. We are focusing on Cricket, Motor racing and Baseball whereas Sorare and Chiliz are primarily in football
  ## 3. We have more in-depth engagements for fans, such as games, NFTs, memberships, quests etc whereas Chiliz focuses on token sale and Sorare focuses on player NFTs.

## Development Roadmap 

  ## we are proposing a project to grow the user base and number of transactions exponentially for VeChain. Therefore, our milestone is purely based on transparent metrics such as DappRadar rankings. We don't get paid if we can't deliver based on competitive ranking.
  ## Milestone 1: 
  ## We integrate our dApp with VeChain. We also integration with special tools like MPP and txn fee delegation. This allows us to drive exponential user base to VeChain
  ## We estimate duration to be 2-4 weeks or faster.
  ## FTE required: 3 engineers, plus some marketing required
  ## Milestone 2:
  ## We achieve a DappRadar ranking of 50 (under social dApp category) or higher for our dApp. We will achieve it within 2-4 weeks of integration. After that we will work with VeChain to significantly grow our UAW on VeChain.
  ## Total costs: USDC 25000
  ## We can provide any documentation required as well as technical testing etc. as part of the project.

  
This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
